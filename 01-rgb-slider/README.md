# RGB Slider

I really love what aarthificial does [here in his YouTube DevLog video](https://youtu.be/HsOKwUwL1bE?si=O2PFI_3YaPBcF733&t=71) where he zooms in on a pixel in his pixel-art character. Then he creates a RGBA window with sliders. This is a really common representation for a RGB color picker, but I think it'd be a good first project to try and tackle.

I suspect this will involve Layouts and Signals, which I haven't experimented much with yet.

I'm happy with how it turned out and learned quite a bit through this first mini-project.
